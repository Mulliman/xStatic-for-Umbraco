# xStatic-for-Umbraco
This is a static site generator built for Umbraco so that you can host simple Umbraco sites on fast and cheap hosting providers such as netlify.

For more information on why it could be of use to you, please visit https://www.sammullins.co.uk/software/xstatic-for-umbraco/

xStatic can be extended to meet specific needs and documentation for this can be found at https://www.sammullins.co.uk/software/xstatic-for-umbraco/extending-xstatic/

## Getting started

In v15 onwards you simply need to install the package xstatic from NuGet and that is it.

When installed, and Umbraco is run you should see a new section in your backoffice.

There are extension methods on the xstatic builder that can be used to change how security works, but it is unlikely that this is required.
